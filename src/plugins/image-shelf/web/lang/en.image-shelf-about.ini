introduction_content = "The image-shelf plugin provides an easy way to populate new network-deployment Images from operating-system templates.
			The operating-system templates are simply tar.gz files containing a Linux root-filesystem (with an empty /proc and /sys dir).
			The image-shelf plugin comes with a pre-configured Image-shelf sponsored by <a href='http://www.openqrm-enterprise.com/' target='_BLANK'>openQRM Enterprise</a>.
			Custom Image-shelfs can be added using various different protocols (local/FTP/HTTP/HTTPS/NFS). The Image-shelf content is configured by a configuration file 'image-shelf.conf' located in the same directory as the templates.
			(here an example self-explaining <a href='/openqrm/base/plugins/image-shelf/image-shelf.conf' target='_BLANK'>image-shelf.conf</a>)
			<br><br>
			Please notice that the Image-Shelfs templates can be used to populate Images from type 'lvm-nfs-deployment' ('lvm-storage' plugin) and 'nfs-deployment' ('nfs-storage' plugin).
			From those NFS-based storage types Images can be easily transferred to e.g. Iscsi- or Aoe-deployment Images via the INSTALL_FROM deployment parameters.
			<br><br>
			<b>How to use :</b><br><ul>
			<li>Enable the &quot;nfs-storage&quot; or &quot;lvm-storage&quot; plugin</li>
			<li>Create a Storage-server from the type &quot;NFS-Storage&quot; or &quot;Lvm Storage Server (Nfs)&quot;<br>(You can use the openQRM-server itself as resource or a existing system in your network integrated with the 'local-server' plugin)</li>
			<li>Create an new Volume (Image) on the NFS-Storage server via the &quot;nfs-storage&quot; or &quot;lvm-storage&quot; plugin</li>
			<li>Now Click on the Image-shelf</li>
			<li>Select an Image-Shelf from the list</li>
			<li>Select an Server-Template from the list</li>
			<li>Select the just created (empty) NFS-Image</li>
			<li>Check the Event-list for the progress of the Image creation</li>
			</ul>"
